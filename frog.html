He passed a well and heard frogs croak. For some reason
Apoopan thought that the frogs were making fun of him. He got annoyed
and said </p>

<p> "Don't you dare make fun of me. My Son is a doctor and he will gather
you all up and dissect you." </p>

<p> But the frogs continued to cry and croak. Apoopan got angry
and scolded </p>

<p> "My other son is a Police inspector. He will beat the hell out of you." </p>

<p> The frogs continued to shout in the well making Apoopan mad with anger. </p>

<p> "No respect for old people!" said Apoopan. "I will  teach you a
lesson myself." </p>

<p> Apoopan then picked up a stick and jumped into the well to hit the frogs.
